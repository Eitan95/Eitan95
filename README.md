Hi My name is Eitan. I am really appasionate about cloud services and Unix, I got a bachelors degree in Automation, that means I spare my time working with machines to make 
life easier in a professional and personal way (Domotics/Mechatronics/HDMI)

I studied in Puebla, a city near Mexico city where I achieved the knowledge to implement mechanics, visual programming and electronics in a particular device.


Now I am study hardly in Mérida, at ITK where I am learning important skills to reach success such as soft skills and businness skills.

Recently I got my first badge in Oracle Cloud Foundations, I hope to take advantages from this path to become a successful cloud engineer. And as I mentioned 
I involve automation in Cloud using terraform files :) 


Please feel free to take a look in my repository :) I will make more creative stuffs on the way
